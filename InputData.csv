CAST AI,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cast-ai,38000000,USD,38000000,Active,"CAST AI is a cloud optimization platform that reduces cloud costs, optimizes DevOps, and automates disaster recovery. CAST AI's intelligent optimization engine delivers a cost-efficient, high-performing, and resilient infrastructure for every Kubernetes workload.  CAST AI brings resource and cost optimization to Kubernetes using an AI-driven optimization engine that applies cluster changes based on real-time workload conditions. It selects the most cost-effective instance types and bin-packs pods for maximum utilization. The platform uses spot instances that offer 70 to 90% discounts and are automatically selected for any stateless workloads. CAST AI also sets pod scaling parameters to achieve optimal application performance while maximizing cost savings. Moreover, users get detailed cost reports to enable forecasting expenses at the level of the project, cluster, namespace, and deployment, down to individual microservices. CAST AI provides an opinionated Kubernetes implementation that hides the infrastructure complexities with automation. So DevOps engineers no longer have to deal with IaaS complexity and can finally focus on higher-order cloud-native abstractions and concepts. They can create and manage CAST AI components through API, CLI, and Terraform to automate their infrastructure lifecycle management. CAST AI also provides services for in-cluster observability (logging, tracing, and metrics) and built-in security (encryption at rest and in transit). CAST AI protects workloads against downtime with a Disaster Avoidance strategy based on cloud neutrality and multi-cloud capabilities. To achieve 100% uptime, CAST AI adopts the active approach to Disaster Recovery by stretching applications and data across multiple clouds so that a cloud failure never becomes a disaster. Underlying all of our technology is a custom multi-cloud networking layer that makes the magic happen.",Undisclosed,"North Miami Beach, Florida, United States","Greater Miami Area, East Coast, Southern US","CAST is an AI-driven cloud optimization platform that slashes cloud cost, optimizes DevOps, and automates disaster prevention.",2019-10-01,day,"Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics, Hardware, Information Technology, Internet Services, Privacy and Security, Science and Engineering, Software","Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, Cloud Infrastructure, Cloud Management, Cloud Security, Developer Platform, Developer Tools, SaaS",2023-03-01,20000000,USD,20000000,38000000,USD,38000000,"Samsung NEXT, Creandum, TA Ventures, Cota Capital, SAV (Scale Asia Ventures)",Private,,,,https://www.cast.ai/,Women Founded,,,,,,For Profit,https://twitter.com/cast_ai,https://www.facebook.com/CASTAi-112140013763781/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/cast-ai,hello@cast.ai,+1 917-880-8288,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,"Augustinas Stirbis, Austeja Zymantaite, Laurent Gil, Leon Kuperman, Vilius Zukauskas, Yuri Frayman",11-50,4,,20000000,USD,20000000,Undisclosed,2,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,463,461,,4,8.8,7.2,11,"Engineering, Finance, Management, Marketing, Operations",15,,"22,557","26,621.17",-13.92%,404,-57.25%,1.66,33.25%,75%,-15.51%,"1,180,665","73,108",6.6%,83,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a world that is highly dynamic and competitive, Taktile helps companies bring products to market quicker, reduce risk in decision-making, adapt to change faster, and constantly improve their margins. We help lenders determine if someone should be eligible for a loan and help insurers decide what the price of an insurance should be. With our platform, the right people in the organization can take control. Decision-makers easily make changes to complex decision flows without engineering assistance, back-test the change to see what its impact would have been, and even iterate repeatedly to ensure they are making the best decision before implementing the new flow. Taktile also converts decision logs and historical data into actionable assets that risk managers can use to react to dynamic markets and evaluate the impact of every change to their decision flows before setting them live – enabling them to choose facts over gut feeling.

Together they have developed a new process incorporating video game technology with photorealistic 3D models inserted into film and TV broadcast,  to disrupt the $23B branded entertainment industry. Branded entertainment in movies & TV shows is currently a $23B globally ($10B USA) industry available only to major brands and growing at 17% CAGR.  Simultaneously, interstitial TV advertising is in decline whilst proliferating content (487 new scripted shows in 2017). This means a declining return on assets. At the same time, ad-skipping and ad-blocking are devastating traditional revenue models. Remarkably, branded entertainment today is a manual process whereby products are delivered by hand to set. Additionally, simple adjustments in camera movement such as a pan left or right can obfuscate a brand requiring reshoots. Brands are also fixed in perpetuity and not able to be edited or updated. By introducing digital technology, we can bring branded entertainment into the modern world and disrupt incumbents creating a multibillion-dollar cutting edge business.

Typically, before Pitchly, this work takes place in disconnected and inefficient tools like Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Sharepoint, or IT-owned databases. The platform aggregates disparate information sources, making information easy to catalog, find, and produce compelling and relevant data-driven Word and PowerPoint documents. This generates a 93% reduction in time to create data-heavy documents with 100% error reduction; all in half the time it takes to locate information when compared to traditional approaches. Pitchly end-users can even create custom forms to populate data to those original sources to make certain their teams are using the most relevant and up-to-date data. It aggregates digital data sources, such as Excel, SQL, Salesforce, and more, into one normalized tabular view of the data to reference, search, filter, and then integrate into documents and presentations in real-time. The platform gives the ability to easily publish select information from your database(s) on a website, in various digital forms.
